/**
 * Verdict attestation: make agents prove what they checked.
 *
 * An agent that reviews, audits or tests something writes an attestation: its
 * verdict, plus the SHA-256 of every file it actually read. Before anything
 * ships, `verifyAttestations` re-hashes those files on the tree as it stands
 * now and refuses if anything moved.
 *
 * Why: a verdict on its own proves nothing. An agent (or a CI job checking the
 * wrong branch) can report "passed" about a file that has since changed, or that
 * it never looked at. Binding the verdict to a content hash turns "trust me"
 * into something a gate can check deterministically, with no model calls.
 *
 * Everything here is pure Node: `node:crypto`, `node:fs`, `node:path`.
